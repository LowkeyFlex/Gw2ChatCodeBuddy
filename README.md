## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
You got (good) Raid Experience but you can't get into a raid group because you don't have enough Legendary Insights? :pensive:  
You already killed a Raid Boss but you don't have the Kill Proofs anymore? :persevere:  
You are just lazy and don't want to carry your LIs/LDs and KPs around with you and/or are too lazy to spam it? :smirk:

Then Gw2ChatCodeBuddy is what you need.
It calculates the Chat Code for a certain amount of LIs, LDs, KPs or any other item chatcode, copies it to the clipboard and emulates the key strokes "enter" and "left control" + "v" to post it.
You can assign different amounts of LIs/LDs, KPs or any other item chatcode to the Hotkeys F1-F11 (or even to any other key).

I'm currently learning Python and i wanted to do a script which may be useful for some people. :)  
I use PyInstaller to pack the script into an executable. So you only have 1 file which you can easily use.

## Guide <a name="guide"></a>
[YouTube Video on how to use :)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TT-YfTw1A1U)

1. Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/LowkeyFlex/Gw2ChatCodeBuddy/releases) (as .exe)
2. Start Gw2ChatCodeBuddy.exe
3. Choose which button to assign
4. Choose LI/LD, any W1-W7 Boss Kill Proof, Fractal 100cm Kill Proof or paste codes from the wiki
5. Choose amount
6. Press "g" and enter to start (you can't use the console until you press P to pause the hotkeys)
7. Click into Guild Wars 2
8. Press the assigned hotkeys to post the dedicated chat code into the chat / P to pause hotkeys 
9. ...
10. Profit?

You can now save your assignmends to a .config file by writing s and load them by writing g.
By doing that, you can skip the steips 3. to 5. the next time you use it :)

Notes: 
- make sure you are in the right chat and that your chatbox isn't currently open

## Create the .exe yourself <a name="exe"></a>
[YouTube Tutorial :)](https://youtu.be/G6q5eWTk3ms)
-> Install Python 3.7
-> Download Project as Zip
-> Extract the Zip
-> Inside Project Folder open Powershell as Admin
-> Run following commands:
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
pyinstaller .\Gw2ChatCodeBuddy.py --clean --onefile
-> Your exe is now in the folder dist

## Known Problems <a name="known_problems"></a>

### "The chatbox is only kind of blinking, but nothing gets pasted"
Try to start Gw2ChatCodeBuddy.exe as administrator and try again.
If it still doesn't work, try to increase the latency.
Feel free to contact me, if you still have this problem, or if it could be resolved by following these steps.

### "api-ms-win-crt-runtime-l1-1-0.dll is missing"
Install windows updates. you can also get the needed .dll with an update from here:  
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2999226/update-for-universal-c-runtime-in-windows  
tested on fresh installed win7 & 10

[globalhotkeys.py](https://gist.github.com/m10x/a9a2eb296fab2106a5ae7c16b8874a4b) I forged it from [mdavey](https://gist.github.com/mdavey/6d40a89dbc15aefcc8cd) and improved it (it works now also great with python 3) ;)

[key_define.py](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14489013/simulate-python-keypresses-for-controlling-a-game) I've found it on stackoverflow and made it PEP8 compliant

## Donations <a name="donations"></a>
As i got asked a few times, you can donate via [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/LowkeyFlex) or [BuyMeACoffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/m10xde) to me.
I've spend much of my spare time to create and update this program.
Don't feel urged to donate, kind comments pay off even as much.
